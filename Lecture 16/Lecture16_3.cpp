// Space Complexity of selection sort function.
// As we have only made a few variables and nothing else the space complexity is
// O(1)

// Time complexity of selection sort function.
// O(n^2)

// Best case time complexity
// O(n^2)

// Worst case time complexity
// O(n^2)

// Use case (Kab use karna chahiye): - When ever we have small size array. And when we have less memory.
