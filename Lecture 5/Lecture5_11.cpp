// Variables & scope 

// We can make declare a variable in if loop even though we have declared a variable with same name in the main function. And it is valid. As the int in the for loop is valid for the scope of for loop only. ANd it cannot be accessed out of that scope.
// Variable with same name cannot be declared in the same scope.

// If the i is declared in the main function and it is also declared in the initialization block of the for loop then for loop will use the variable in the initialization block of the for loop.

// If the i is declared in the main block and it is not declared in the initialization block of the for block then the for block will use the variable in the main function.
